# stock-quote-slackbot
A slackbot that retrieves stock quote information from Yahoo Finance given a ticker symbol in Slack.

## Background
Stockbot is Slack's Python-based [real-time messaging bot](https://github.com/slackhq/python-rtmbot) wrapped around Łukasz Banasiak's [Python wrapper](https://github.com/lukaszbanasiak/yahoo-finance/) for the Yahoo Finance API.

### Usage

There are two ways to use stockbot. The first is to input the trigger word ('quote' by default) and one or more stock tickers. 
You'll get back a separate reply for each stock listed.  

The second usage is to enter the word 'range', a ticker symbol, and a start and end date. 
Stockbot will return the average stock price over that date range.  

In both cases, the trigger word must be the first word in the message. It is not case sensitive.  

### Example Usage  

    >>> quote GOOG YHOO
    Stock​: 'GOOG'
    Current Price​: $742.60
    Day Range​: $741.27 - $754.93
    52 Wk Range​: $486.23 - $762.71

    Market Cap​: $31.93B
    
    >>> range yhoo 2014-11-30 2015-11-30
    The average price for 'YHOO' from 2014-11-30 to 2015-11-30 is: $40.41

 Also, pick a trigger word in the rtmbot.conf file.

4. Run it! (You've got to keep it running as long as you want to use it; something like [nohup](http://linux.die.net/man/1/nohup) might be helpful.)
